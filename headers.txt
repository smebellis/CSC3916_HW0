>>> Request Headers:

    User-Agent: PostmanRuntime/7.26.10
        
        - A string the lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requestion user-agent

    Accept: */*
        
        - Advertises which content types the client is able to understand.

    Postman-Token: defee8e8-6386-49bb-abe7-8079ddcf3352
        
        - This is primarily used to bypass a bug in Chrome. If an XMLHttpRequest is pending and another request is sent with the same parameters then 
        Chrome returns the same response for both of them. Sending a random token avoids this issue. This can also help you distinguish between request 
        on the server side. 

    Host: www.googleapis.com

        - Specifices the host and port number of the server to which the request is being sent. If no poer is included, the default port for the service
        requested is implied

    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

        - Advertises which content encoding, usually a compression algorithm, the client is able to understand.  

    Connection: keep-alive

        - Controls wherther or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes.  

>>> Response Headers:

    Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

        - Tells the client what the content type of the returned content actually is.

    Vary: Origin

        - Determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server
        Origin indicates a header name to take into account when deciding whether or not a cached response can be used.

    Vary: X-Origin

        - Determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server
         X-Origin indicates a header name to take into account when deciding whether or not a cached response can be used.

    Vary: Referer

        - Determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server. 
        Referer indicates a header name to take into account when deciding whether or not a cached response can be used.

    Content-Encoding: gzip

        - This is the originial format of the UNIX gzip program.  The HTTP/1.1 standard also recommends that the servers supporting this content-encoding should 
        recgonize x-gzip as an alias, for compatibility purposes.

    Date: Thu, 28 Jan 2021 20:19:20 GMT

        - Contains the date and time at which the message was originated. 

    Server: ESF

        - Describes the software used by the origin server that handled the request.

    Cache-Control: private

        - Holds directives (instructions) for caching in both requests and responses.  Private means the response may be stored only by a browser's cache, even If
        the response is normally non-cacheable.

    X-XSS-Protection: 0

    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

        - Used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>.  Sites can use thie to avoid 
        click-jacking attacks.

    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

        - A marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed.  

    Alt-Svc: h3-29=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-T051=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q050=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q046=":443"; ma=2592000,h3-Q043=":443"; ma=2592000,quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="46,43"

        - Used to advertise alternatice services through which the same resource can be reached.  An althernative service is defined by a protocol/host/port combination

    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
